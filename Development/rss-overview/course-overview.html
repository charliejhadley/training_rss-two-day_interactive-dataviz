# RSS: Interactive Visualisations with R
### Martin John Hadley

---





# Course Materials and Structure

This course is entirely self-contained, the lecturer notes and exercises have been written using RMarkdown. 

The course is split into three different types of activity.

---

# Lecture slides

These are written in RMarkdown, which is a technology you'll learn how to use in the first day of training.

&gt; You'll be shown how to make the lecture slides work on your machine at the end of the day.

---

# Live/group coding

Most of the exercises we'll go through are "live coding exercises", the lecturer will write code that you'll copy to your machine. What we end up building together will be very dependent on what you're interested in as a group.

&gt; At the end of each section the lecturer will provide a download link for the **exact** code on their machines.

---

# Exercises

There are a set of exercises in the materials that might be included in the course itself or else you might be encouraged to work on after the course.

&gt; As the live coding sections of the course are unique for each class, it might be that we cover the learning points from the exercises in our group work.

# Timetable Overview

This course runs over two days, each day we cover the following topics:

.pull-left[
**Day One**
- Up and running with RStudio
- Reproducible dataviz workflows with the tidyverse
- Static charts with `ggplot2`
- Interactive charts with `htmlwidgets`
- Combining text, charts and interactive stuff with RMarkdown
]

.pull-right[
**Day Two**
- `shiny`
- Combining `htmlwidgets` with `shiny`
- Publishing interactive web apps using `shiny`
]
---

# What do you know?

We'll cover three major subjects in this course; `htmlwidgets`, RMarkdown and `shiny`. Easily using these tools requires familiarity with a range of different packages and parts of the R language.

It's not necessary for you to have any particular experience with R before this course, it will help me adjust this course to you by answering the following questions:

- Who has never used R before?
- Who has used RStudio?
- Who has used Projects in RStudio?
- Who has used ggplot2?
- Who is familiar with what this is called `%&gt;%` and why it's used?
- Who has used the tidyverse?
- Who has used htmlwidgets?
- Who has used RMarkdown?
- Who has used Shiny?
