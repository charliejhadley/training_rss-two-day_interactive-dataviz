# Course Materials and Structure

This course is entirely self-contained, the lecturer notes and exercises have been writtedn using RMarkdown. 

You will primarily be working in the RSS_handouts folder, by the end of the day you'll have enough experience with R and RMarkdown that you'll be able to run the lecturer notes on your own machine.

The course will follow this general structure:

```{r}
# timetable <- list(
#   "10:00 - 11:00" = "Getting started with R and the tidyverse",
#   "11:00 - 11:30" = "Coffee",
#   "11:30 - 12:30" = "Interative visualisations with htmlwidgets",
#   "12:30 - 14:00" = "Lunch",
#   "14:00 - 15:00" = "Interactive reports with RMarkdown",
#   "15:00 - 15:30" = "Coffee",
#   "15:30 - 17:00" = "Interactive dashboards with Shiny"
#   )
#   library("tidyverse")
#   timetable <- tibble(times = names(timetable),
#   topic = as.character(timetable))
#   knitr::kable(timetable)

timetable <- list(
  
  "09:30 - 11:00" = "Up and Running",
  "11:20 - 12:30" = "htmlwidgets",
  "13:30 - 15:00" = "RMarkdown",
  "15:20 - 16:30" = "Shiny"
  # 
  # 
  # "10:00 - 11:00" = "Getting started with R and the tidyverse",
  # "11:00 - 11:30" = "Coffee",
  # "11:30 - 12:30" = "Interative visualisations with htmlwidgets",
  # "12:30 - 14:00" = "Lunch",
  # "14:00 - 15:00" = "Interactive reports with RMarkdown",
  # "15:00 - 15:30" = "Coffee",
  # "15:30 - 17:00" = "Interactive dashboards with Shiny"
)
library("tidyverse")
timetable <- tibble(
  times = names(timetable),
  topic = as.character(timetable)
)
knitr::kable(timetable)
```

# Questions

Before continuing with the course, I'd like to understand everyone's experience with R thus far:

- Who has never used R before?
- Who has used RStudio?
- Who has used Projects in RStudio?
- Who has used ggplot2?
- Who is familiar with what this is called %>% and why it's used?
- Who has heard of the tidyverse?
- Who has heard of htmlwidgets? Who has used them?
- Who has used Shiny?

# Course Overview

This course is designed to introduce you to the basics of creating interactive data visualisations using R; with two very different technologies:

- RMarkdown
- Shiny

No prior knowledge of R is expected, the necessary "programming patterns" and workflows will be introduced through the course.

Please note that this course will **NOT** provide a sufficient overview of the R language to start analysing data and doing useful stuff.

>* This course shows you how to make Shiny stuff.

# Scope of Course

This course covers the following topics:

>- Importing and wrangling data with the tidyverse

>- Tools for building an understanding of your data

>- Building interactive maps, networks and charts using htmlwidgets

# Maps with leaflet

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library("leaflet")
library("tidyverse")
locations <- read_csv("data/university-locations.csv")
leaflet(locations,
        options = leafletOptions(zoomControl = FALSE)) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(label = ~University)
```

# Networks with visNetwork

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library("visNetwork")

## Data from https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones and manipulated by hand by https://shiring.github.io/

got_nodes <- read_csv("data/GoT_nodes.csv")
got_edges <- read_csv("data/GoT_edges.csv")

got_nodes <- got_nodes %>%
  mutate(group = superculture)

visNetwork(got_nodes,
           got_edges) %>%
  visIgraphLayout() %>%
  visLegend(ncol = 2)
```

# Charts with plotly and highcharter

Plotly

```{r}
library("oidnChaRts")
library("plotly")
data_stacked_bar_chart %>%
  filter(timestamp == max(timestamp)) %>%
  group_by(country_group, occupation) %>%
  summarise(total.jobs = sum(count)) %>%
  plot_ly() %>%
  add_trace(
    x = ~total.jobs,
    y = ~country_group,
    color = ~occupation
  ) %>%
  layout(margin = list(l = 150),
         yaxis = list(title = ""))
```

Highcharter

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library("highcharter")

data_stacked_bar_chart %>%
  filter(timestamp == max(timestamp)) %>%
  group_by(country_group, occupation) %>%
  summarise(total.jobs = sum(count)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(country_group) %>%
  mutate(country_total = sum(total.jobs)) %>%
  arrange(desc(country_total)) %>%
  hchart(
    type = "bar",
  hcaes(
    y = total.jobs,
    x = country_group,
    group = occupation
  ))

```

# Scope of Course

This course covers the following topics:

- Importing and wrangling data with the tidyverse

- Tools for building an understanding of your data

- Building interactive maps, networks and charts using htmlwidgets

- Writing documents/presentations using RMarkdown; including text, code and interactive output in the same document

# RPubs

[RPubs.com](rpubs.com) is a free and open platform for publishing and sharing HTML RMarkdown documents with others.

RPubs and Shiny are both maintained by the team behind RStudio and are fully integrated into the IDE.

Note that while documents hosted on RPubs are made public, the underlying code/.rmd files cannot be downloaded by others.

*for complicated things, you might need a little bit of CSS/HTML/JavaScript

# Basic Shiny Example

This is an example of a shiny app from the [shiny.rstudio.com](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/tabsets.html) website:
