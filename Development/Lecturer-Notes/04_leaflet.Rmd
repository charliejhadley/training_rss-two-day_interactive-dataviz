## Leaflet

Leaflet objects are "instantiated" with the leaflet function, but they don't have anything in them other than zoom buttons:

```{r}
library("leaflet")
leaflet()
```

## Leaflet base maps

The map "backgrounds" are provided as "tiles", the default option (Open Street Maps) is selected using the `addTiles` function:

```{r}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles()
```

## Leaflet provider tiles

However, the default maps aren't the prettiest in the world. A wide selection of different maps are available from [http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html](http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html)

```{r}
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldShadedRelief)
```

## Plotting locations with leaflet

Leaflet provides a number of options for visualising specific locations, let's duplicate the project you were working on before and create some maps of the data there.

## Geomarker plot (I)

Load in the "detailed-journies.csv" file ready to create a geomarker plot.

Leaflet will automatically guess which columns are longitude and latitude if it can:

```{r}
quakes %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addMarkers()
```

## Geomarker plot (II)

We could rename the start.latitude and start.longitude columns from our dataset if we wanted:

```{r}
journeys %>%
  rename(latitude = start.latitude)
```

But we can also tell leaflet to explicitly use certain columns from the tibble piped into it:

```{r}
journeys %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldShadedRelief) %>%
  addMarkers()
```

## Leaflet addCircleMarkers (I)

The markers used in the previous slide are not that easy to customise, and can only relay the location of a place.

How about if we wanted to communicate the popularity of a location, i.e. the number of letters sent from a location?

Well, first we need some dplyr verbs:

```{r}
journeys %>%
  select(contains("start"), number.of.letters) %>%
  group_by(start.location)
```

## Leaflet addCircleMarkers (II)

Now we've prepared our data, we can add our circle markers - remembering to set the radius of the circles to the new column we've created:

```{r}
total_letters_sent %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldShadedRelief) %>%
  addCircleMarkers()
```

## Leaflet addCircleMarkers (III)

The map looks ugly is a sin, we should consider using the scales package to sensibly scale the sizes of the circles.

```{r}
scales::rescale(total_letters_received$total.letters, to = c(1, 10))
```

## Leaflet and choropleth

Choropleth are shaded area maps, and require you to find "shapefiles" for the areas you wish to shade.

These areas are, of course, typically countries or subdivisions of countries.

There are basically two competing packages (or approaches) to working with shapefiles in R, I thoroughly recommend you go with the `sf` library*.

## Leaflet and the contiguous United States (I)

To demonstrate `sf` objects, let's use the `statesRcontiguous` library I recently published to CRAN.

```{r}
library("statesRcontiguous")
shp_all_us_states
```

*If you have problems installing the sf library, refer to [https://github.com/r-spatial/sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)

## Leaflet and the contiguous United States (II)

We can use `sf` objects with the tidyverse easily, for instance if we wanted to restrict ourselves to the continental United States we could do the following:

```{r}
shp_all_us_states %>%
  filter(contiguous.united.states == TRUE)
```

To visualise this object with leaflet, we use `addPolygons`

```{r}
shp_all_us_states %>%
  filter(contiguous.united.states == TRUE) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addPolygons()
```
